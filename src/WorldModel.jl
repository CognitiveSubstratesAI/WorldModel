# WorldModel — the live PRIMUS world-modeling application.
#
# STANDALONE BY DESIGN. This package has NO hard package dependencies: clone it and it loads on a bare
# Julia. It is an APPLICATION (a live, stateful cognitive system), not a reusable library — and it stays
# dependency-free by talking to substrate capabilities (MeTTa evaluation, MORK spaces, the algorithm
# libraries) through a PLUGGABLE `AbstractBackend` injected at RUNTIME. So anyone can use it on its own,
# against whatever backend they have (an in-process MeTTaCore adapter, a MorkServer/MettaJam socket
# client, or a mock for tests). Per the architecture decision (docs/decisions.md), it lives in its own
# repo so application glue + live state never pollute — and never depend on — the substrate libraries.
#
# Architecture (Hyperon Whitepaper 2025 §4 two-loop):
#   Goal-directed loop:  MetaMo → PLN → MOSES / GEO-EVO → PC (ActPC) → SubRep
#   Ambient loop:        ECAN → pattern mining (WILLIAM) → concept blending → factor-graph PLN
#   Shared controls:     geodesic control · quantale-weakness (Occam prior)
#   Memory substrate:    13 Spaces (§7 / vibe-eng Appendix A) — Senv/Sevid/Sent/Smap/Srule/Shmh/…
#
# STATUS: scaffold. The loop is wired SCENARIO-DRIVEN (Minecraft affordance discovery / social-robot
# anti-hallucination), building only the slice a concrete scenario needs (measure-first).

"""
    AbstractBackend

The seam between the standalone WorldModel application and whatever substrate runs underneath. A backend
provides the capabilities the cognitive loop needs — at minimum [`wm_eval`](@ref) (evaluate a MeTTa
program) and [`wm_query`](@ref) (support count of a pattern). Concrete backends live OUTSIDE this package (a
MeTTaCore in-process adapter, a server client, or a test mock), so WorldModel itself never takes a hard
dependency on the substrate and remains usable on its own.

    goal_step!(loop, goal; affordances, beliefs=Dict()) -> Vector{Tuple{String,Float64}}

One step of the goal-directed loop (Hyperon Whitepaper 2025 §4): given a `goal` — a desired outcome
pattern, the MetaMo *motive* — search the discovered `affordances` (the ambient loop's composites, the
PLN/knowledge) for ones whose OUTCOME clause matches the goal's predicate, and propose their ACTION
clause as a program (the MOSES role). Each proposal is CERTIFIED (the SubRep role) by an affordance
confidence: an explicit override in `beliefs`, else — when a `backend` is wired — the affordance is
checked against the substrate (support `n` of its join body → §1b confidence `n/(n+1)`), else `1`.
Returns the certified `(action, confidence)` options, most-certified first.

Minimal slice: affordance-based backward lookup over the ambient loop's output (goal → action), certified
by substrate support. Full PLN backward chaining, MOSES program search, PC forecasting are richer slices.

    attention_step!(loop; boost=Dict(), rent=0.1, focus_threshold=0.0) -> Vector{String}

The ambient loop's first step — ECAN attention diffusion (Hyperon Whitepaper 2025 §4 / §5.5). Updates the
loop's STI (short-term importance) over atoms: decays everything by `rent` (economic forgetting), adds
`boost` (wages for atoms that proved useful), then NORMALIZES so STI sums to unity — the §5.5 constraint
that "STI must sum to unity across the attentional focus" (the conservation / budget law). Returns the
**attentional focus**: atoms with STI strictly above `focus_threshold` — the candidates the rest of the
ambient loop (mining → blending → factor-PLN) should spend effort on.

Minimal slice: rent-decay + wage-boost + normalization → focus. Full Hebbian spreading-activation over a
link graph (§5.5; `Core/lib/ecan` `ecan-spread-step!`, MORKTensorNetworks `ecan_sti_spread!`) is richer.

    ambient_step!(loop; candidates=String[], minsup=2) -> Vector{String}

One step of the ambient background loop (Hyperon Whitepaper 2025 §4): pattern mining **"spots recurring
structures"**. For each candidate pattern, read its support via the backend (the §7.3 `support` /
`match-count` op = [`wm_query`](@ref)), keep those with support `≥ minsup`, advance the loop tick, and
return the frequent (recurring) patterns.

This is the minimal mining slice of the ambient loop (ECAN → mining → concept blending → factor-PLN);
attention diffusion (ECAN), concept blending (`expand-conjunction`), and belief tightening (factor-PLN)
are later slices. Runs against any [`AbstractBackend`](@ref).

"""
    blend_step!(loop, patterns; minsup=2) -> Vector{String}

One step of concept blending (Hyperon Whitepaper 2025 §4 — "concept blending invents composites").
Combines pairs of patterns that SHARE A VARIABLE into composite conjunctions: the shared variable is the
"generic space" the two blend over, and the join `(, P1 P2)` is the category-theoretic **pushout** over
it (cf. the conceptBlending upstream's colimit blend; §7.3 `expand-conjunction`). Keeps composites whose
support via the backend ≥ `minsup` — a minimal optimality filter (well-supported, integrated blends).
Returns the composite blends.

Minimal substrate-native slice: the deterministic pushout-on-shared-vars + support filter, *without* the
LLM spec/morphism generation of the full category-theoretic pipeline. Richer blends (full colimit; the
Fauconnier-Turner optimality constraints — integration/topology/unpacking/good-reason) are later slices.

One step of factor-graph PLN belief tightening (Hyperon Whitepaper 2025 §4 / §1b). For each pattern, read
its evidence count via the backend (support) and derive a count-based **truth value** — the §1b point that
"evidence counts … fall out from the quantale structure": confidence `= n / (n + k)` rises with evidence
`n`. Returns `(pattern, count, confidence)` triples — the tightened beliefs.

Minimal slice: the leaf evidence→TV (count-based confidence). The full factor-graph propagation — quantale
product `⊗` at factor atoms, sum `⊕` at variable atoms over the blends (§1b) — and strength from ±evidence
are richer slices that the substrate's PLN (`Core/lib/pln`) provides; this slice orchestrates the leaf TVs.

factor-PLN**, threading each step's output into the next and **closing the attention feedback** — the
believed atoms are waged back into the loop's STI, so useful structure keeps attention across cycles.
`candidates` are the patterns to consider this cycle (boosted into attention). Returns the cycle's
attentional `focus`, the `frequent` patterns, the `blends`, and the `beliefs`.
