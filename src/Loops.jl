# Loops.jl — the two-loop × three-rate cognitive cycle over the braid (§3.1, §3.4, §6.1.4).
#
# PRIMUS runs two interleaved meta-dynamics (§3.1): a GOAL-directed loop (maintain motives, bind a focused
# subnetwork, act + check progress) and an AMBIENT loop (mine / tighten / consolidate in the background),
# at three timescales (§3.4): FAST (ms — Sdyn reflex, NO full Atomspace query per tick), MID (10s–100s ms
# — the goal cycle: ground → encode → lift → summarize → condition), SLOW (s–h — the ambient cycle:
# re-validate stale beliefs → consolidate memory). Every step drives the REAL braid operators on the real
# substrate. The decision PROCESSES (PLN action-selection in mid, WILLIAM mining in slow) are explicit
# hooks, bound when those per-Space algorithm processes land — absent here rather than mocked.

MID path (§3.4 / §6.1.4): the GOAL-directed cycle — store evidence (Sevid), ground the entity (Γ → Sent,
evidence-anchored), encode the trial as an HMH episode (𝓔ₕₘₕ → Shmh), and lift the densified retrieval into
a context vector (Λ → Sctx) that becomes the loop's current context for the fast reflex. The goal is
MOTIVE-GOVERNED: when a `governor` `(; goals, mods, stimulus, candidates)` is supplied and no explicit
`goal`, canonical MetaMo (`metamoGovern`: Ψ appraise → 𝔻 decide → safe-project) SELECTS the goal from the
OpenPsi motive state (§A.9 / infrastructure: S_motive → MetaMo → action selection). PLN then backward-chains
over Srule to select an action for it. Returns `(; cid, context, context_vector, action, goal, governance)`.

    slow_step!(loop; t, threshold=0.3, lambda=0.1, template_key=:template) -> NamedTuple

SLOW path (§3.4 / §6.1.4): the AMBIENT cycle — re-validate stale beliefs (R10: confidence decayed below
`threshold` at time `t`), consolidate Shmh episodes into a template (schema formation), MINE recurring
patterns (WILLIAM over `mine_from` → Smine), CERTIFY proposed option-candidates through canonical SubRep
(lib/subrep CDS+PDS) into Sopt, and — when a `synthesis` task is supplied — SYNTHESIZE a program into
Sprog via the unified `geo_synthesize!` entry. The synthesis MODE follows the spec's two-ends principle:
no backward subgoals ⇒ MOSES (`Score = F − γW`); backward subgoals + `μ>0` ⇒ GEO-EVO
(`Score = F − γW + μ·align`). `synthesis` is a NamedTuple `(; fitness, weakness, primitives[, gamma, mu,
subgoals, rng])`. Returns `(; stale, revalidated, consolidated, mined, admitted, synthesized)`.
Advances the tick.

`stale` are the beliefs whose confidence decayed below `threshold`; `revalidated` are the ones actually
REFRESHED from surviving evidence this step (≤ `revalidate`, the ambient budget). A stale key with no
evidence left is deliberately absent from `revalidated` — it keeps decaying rather than being propped up.
